	/*
		1. Answer/port our consumer-producer answer from intermediate/task/Answer2 via Executor service.


		2. Convert Part12 class into two section: in one section urls are fetched/invoked normally, concurrently in another and then
		calculate their time differences.


		3. Collect all the data from the urls in Part12 and write those data in files separately. File operations must be done in separate threads.

		4. Grand finale: Final task
		- Make a copy of HttpInvoker class and transform it into a thread safe http class
		(do all required R&Ds first + checkout other thread safe HttpInvoker implementations)
		- Use a single instance of our thread safe invoker class to solve question #3.
		- For task's completion waiting, use Phaser class.
