/**Synchronized : synchronization access/releases lock on monitors which can force only one
 * thread at a time to execute a code block. where atomic integer: doesn't uses lock.it is entirely
 * possible to synchronize only some accesses to a variable and allow other accesses to be unsynchronized
 * (e.g., synchronize all writes to a variable but none of the reads from it).atomic operation is more faster than synchronization.
 *
 * volatile variable modifying its value immediately affects the actual memory storage for the variable.its only solve the
 * visibility issues except preventing race condition occured.
