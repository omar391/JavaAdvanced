public class Questions {

/*
		1. - Write a short note on differences among: Synchronization vs Atomic variable vs Volatile variable.
			 - Write a class to demonstrate that internal resources(variables) have same shared addresses if participating threads use
			 shared runnable instance. Use 3 threads where two of them share same runnable instance and the other one use a new runnable instance.

			 hint: System.out.println(object): will print object's value with its integer address via an "@" sign.
			 Same address means it's the very same object used by two different threads and that's why it is called a "shared object".


		2. Based on Part3 and Part4, write an example class which proves, volatile variable doesn't prove harmful race conditions.
			 Hint: You could just copy the required code sections from Part3.


		3. Write an example class demonstrating the use of ThreadLocal class (from Part4). Let Google help you. :)


		4. Based on Part5 class, implement following multiple task dependencies: task1->task3->task2


		5. Checkout the example2/producer-consumer problem in - http://www.programcreek.com/2009/02/notify-and-wait-example/
		-  Will their example2 face missing-signal/spurious wake up problems?
		-  Now re-Write the producer-consumer example using the waitNotifierThree class from Part5.
